# markdownConverter
Shell script to convert Markdown files to either pdf or html files. If the file is being converted to html, then the script will add a **css template** to the html file to make it look similar to the **_GitHub Markdown style_**.

* The output file's name will be the same one as the input file's name but with either the .hmtl or .pdf file extension. 

* If the script is being executed in Mac OS X, then it can open the newly created file with *open* (shell built-in command); in Linux or other Unix systems the files are not automatically opened upon completion of the conversion. (This functionality is currently commented out of the current code version)

**The script is far from done, specially the flag parsing and flag error handling require some major changes! The API might change in the future (alpha version).**

## Dependencies
* **pandoc**, if pandoc is not present in the system, the script will issue an error and exit.
In order for pandoc to generate pdf files, it usually needs Latex generators (read the pandoc documentation for more details if a pdf file conversion does not work for you!).

* **sed**, if an html file is being generated, then the script will use sed to add css styling to the html file generated by pandoc.

## Usage
```
usage: markdownConverter --html | --pdf <input Markdown file name>
	--html : Convert input Markdown file to HTML
	--pdf : Convert input Markdown file to pdf
```
